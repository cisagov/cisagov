# Welcome to `cisagov` #

[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/cisagov/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/cisagov/actions)

Welcome to `cisagov`, the GitHub home for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA)!

This repository is aimed to make it easier to get working with GitHub and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for people who work at or with CISA.

For developer-focused documentation and guides, please visit our
[development-guide repository](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/).

## Common questions ##

### Getting started with GitHub ###

- How do I make a GitHub account?
  - Please see the [FISMA-Ready GitHub Guide](https://github.com/fisma-ready/github)
- Why do I add my work email instead of making a separate work-only GitHub account?
  - Short answer: GitHub terms of service is for one account per person.
  Any commits made will be associated with the user who created them, and
  GitHub allows for granular, role-based access that can also be revoked
  when someone departs CISA.

### GitHub use and access ###

- How do I use GitHub? Where do I start?
  - [18F Intro to GitHub](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/intro-to-github/)
  - [Digital.gov intro to GitHub](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-github/)
  - Always remember that since GitHub is a version control system, all changes
  are saved, so there's nothing we can't fix or undo
- How do I get access to the `cisagov` organization?
  - For federal employees, send your GitHub username to github@cisa.gov
  - For contractors, ask your fed lead to send in your username
- How do I get access to a specific repository?
  - Most repositories are associated with the GitHub Teams that use them,
  so to get access you can contact either github@cisa.gov or a team member
  to get access
- How do I make a new repository?

## Policies and content guides ##

- Working in the public (dos and don'ts, best practices)
  - As a best practice, use the `cisagov` organization issue templates and pull request templates
  - As a best practice, we require code reviews before merging pull requests
- What belongs in `cisagov` vs another GitHub Organization?
  - Here are some questions to ask when considering posting a project to
  CISA's GitHub Organization:
    - Does CISA use or develop the software? Is it developed by or for one of the groups or divisions within CISA?
      - If not, we recommend the authors create their own organization and post it there
    - What source control system is in place currently?
      - Many source control systems, such as Mercurial and GitLab, can export the entire development history for import into GitHub - this is by far the preferred method
    - Is it still under active development or is it in maintenance?
    - How mature is the codebase?
- What belongs on the cisa.gov site instead of on `cisagov` GitHub?
- When should I talk to External Affairs (EA)?
- [What is CISA's open source policy?](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/blob/develop/open-source-policy/policy.md)
